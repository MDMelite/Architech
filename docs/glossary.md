# Glossary: AI Agent System Prototype

This document defines key terms used within the AI Agent System project.

-   **Agent:** A distinct software component (often a service) responsible for specific tasks within the system (e.g., GitHub Agent, API Gateway Agent).
-   **API Gateway:** The agent acting as the public entry point for the system, responsible for routing and potentially translating requests.
-   **Architecture:** The overall structure of the system, including its components, their interactions, and the protocols used.
-   **Command Endpoint (`/command`):** A generic API endpoint designed to handle various complex operations beyond simple CRUD actions, using `command` and `args` parameters. See also **MCP**.
-   **Conversation:** A sequence of interactions related to a specific task, typically involving one or more prompts and responses, managed within a unique session.
-   **Conversation Directory:** A directory on the file system (`conversations/[session_id]/`) that stores all documents related to a specific conversation session.
-   **Copilot Handoff:** The core workflow where a task (defined in a Prompt Document) is passed to a human operator using VS Code specifically for interaction with GitHub Copilot.
-   **Document-Based Workflow:** The approach of using structured text files (markdown documents) passed between components via the file system to manage state and communication, especially for the Copilot Handoff.
-   **External Agent:** An AI system or tool existing outside the core Gateway/GitHub Agent structure that interacts with the system via the API Gateway.
-   **GitHub Agent:** The core internal agent responsible for file operations, Git/GitHub interactions, and managing the document-based workflow.
-   **MCP (Multi-Command Protocol):** Refers to the use of a single API endpoint (like `/command`) that accepts a `command` parameter and an `args` dictionary to route requests to different internal functions or operations. This allows extending functionality without adding numerous unique API routes.
-   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** The simplest version of the prototype that demonstrates the core end-to-end workflow and value proposition.
-   **Orion Log (`logs/orion.md`):** A designated markdown file used by the GitHub Agent (`/log` endpoint) for appending general activity logs or significant events.
-   **Plan (`/plan` endpoint):** An endpoint/command specifically for creating markdown documents, often intended for planning or documentation purposes, typically saved in the `docs/` directory.
-   **Prompt Document:** A structured markdown file generated by an agent (usually the GitHub Agent) containing context and instructions intended for another agent or a human (often for use with GitHub Copilot). Typically named like `[###]_prompt.md`.
-   **Repository:** The target source code repository (on GitHub) that the system interacts with.
-   **Response Document:** A structured markdown file containing the output generated in response to a Prompt Document (often containing code/text generated with Copilot assistance). Typically named like `[###]_response.md` and linked to the corresponding prompt.
-   **Roadmap:** The plan outlining the development phases, milestones, and timelines for the project.
-   **Scaffolding:** The initial code structure, boilerplate, and basic setup for the software project.
-   **Schema Translation:** The process (potentially performed by the API Gateway) of converting the structure/field names of an incoming request to match the format expected by the receiving agent.
-   **Session:** A unique instance of a workflow or conversation, typically identified by a `session_id` and corresponding to a Conversation Directory.
-   **Session ID:** A unique identifier assigned to a conversation.
-   **SSE (Server-Sent Events):** A protocol for allowing a server to push real-time updates to a client over a single HTTP connection (proposed for event notifications).
-   **Stakeholder:** Anyone involved in or affected by the project (developers, operators, users, AI agents).
-   **Station:** (Not used in the provided text, potentially a legacy or alternative term - definition omitted unless clarified).
-   **Tool Discovery:** The mechanism (e.g., a `/tools` endpoint or `tools.json` file) by which the system exposes its available commands/tools and their arguments, often for consumption by LLMs or other agents (See FR1.10).
-   **Use Case:** A specific scenario describing how a user or agent interacts with the system to achieve a goal.
-   **Workflow:** A sequence of steps or tasks performed by agents and humans to complete a process (e.g., the Copilot Handoff workflow).
